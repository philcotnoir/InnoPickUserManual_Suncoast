## Understanding Access Restrictions

Based on your user role, you may see some menu options grayed out or missing entirely:

- **Guest users**: Can view most screens but cannot modify settings or control equipment
- **Clerk users**: Can operate the system but cannot access configuration
- **Manager users**: Can access operational controls but not site setup
- **Admin users**: Have full access to all features

If you need access to a restricted feature, contact your supervisor or system administrator.
