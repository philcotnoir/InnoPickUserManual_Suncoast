## Quick Reference by Symptom

**System won't start:**
→ Check for [E-Stop condition](alert-reference.md#555---e-stop-condition-active)
→ Verify no [unresolved or hidden alerts](../main-screens/alerts-page.md#viewing-all-alerts)

**Alert won't clear:**
→ See [Alert Guidelines](alert-guidelines.md#when-alerts-wont-clear)
→ Verify physical issue is resolved
→ Use [Recovery Action](/main-screens/administration.md#recovery-actions) to send a clear alarm to the motion controller. 

**Case missing from sequence:**
→ See [Case Replacement](case-replacement.md)
→ Check [Case Sequence Page](../main-screens/case-sequence.md)

**Repeated same alert:**
→ See [Alert Guidelines](alert-guidelines.md#recognizing-symptoms-of-bigger-issues)
→ Check for underlying issues

**Photocell fault:**
→ See [Alert Reference](alert-reference.md) codes 109, 119, 121, 123, 709

**Clutch fault:**
→ See [Alert Reference](alert-reference.md) codes 310, 333, 334, 340

**Infeed problem:**
→ See [Alert Reference](alert-reference.md) codes 512, 515, 517

## Troubleshooting Approach

### Step 1: Identify the Problem

1. **Check the [Alerts Page](../main-screens/alerts-page.md)** for current alerts
2. **Note the alert code and message**
3. **Identify which level** is affected
4. **Determine if this is** a new issue or recurring problem

### Step 2: Understand the Situation

1. **Read the alert description** in [Alert Reference](alert-reference.md)
2. **Check the [Home Page Inventory Graph](../main-screens/home-page.md#inventory-graph)** - does it match physical reality?
3. **Consider recent events** - what was happening when the alert occurred?
4. **Look for patterns** - have similar alerts occurred recently?

### Step 3: Resolve the Issue

1. **Follow the resolution steps** in the Alert Reference
2. **Verify physical conditions** match expected state
3. **Make corrections** as needed
4. **Clear the alert** only when underlying issue is resolved

### Step 4: Verify Resolution

1. **Resume operation** (put level back in Auto)
2. **Monitor closely** for recurrence
3. **Report persistent problems** to maintenance

## Safety Reminders

- **Always use E-Stop** if there's immediate danger to personnel or equipment
- **Never bypass safety interlocks** or disable safety devices
- **Lock out equipment** before entering guarded areas
- **Follow lockout/tagout procedures** for maintenance work
- **Report safety concerns** immediately to supervision

## Prevention Tips

### Reduce Alerts Through Good Practices

- Perform visual inspections during [startup](../daily-operations/index.md#startup)
- Monitor production actively as described in [Monitoring](../daily-operations/index.md#monitoring-production)
- Address minor warnings before they become critical
- Keep inventory graphs matched to physical reality
- Maintain clear communication during shifts
- Follow proper [shutdown procedures](../daily-operations/index.md#shutdown)

### Maintain System Health

- Report unusual sounds or movements immediately
- Note patterns in alerts and report to maintenance
- Keep documentation updated
- Follow scheduled maintenance procedures
- Address root causes, not just symptoms
