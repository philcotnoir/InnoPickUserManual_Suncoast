## Overview

This page provides general principles and best practices for successfully resolving InnoPick alerts. Following these guidelines will help you avoid cascading faults and minimize downtime.

## Understanding Level Status Colors

When alerts occur, InnoPick changes the level status indicators to show the severity and type of issue.

### Level Color Meanings

<img src="../images/home/image10.png" width="800" alt="Level Status Colors">

- **Green**: Automatic mode - system is operating normally
- **Yellow**: Manual mode - system is paused
- **Red**: Fault mode - system has an active alert that stopped operation
- **Dark Red**: E-Stop active - safety system engaged (door open or E-Stop pressed)
- **Blue**: Communication Loss

See [Level Status Colors Reference](../reference/level-status-colors.md) for complete details.

### Alert Progression

**When an alarm occurs:**
1. InnoPick stops the affected level
2. Level enters Fault mode (Red) or E-Stop status (Dark Red)
3. Alert appears on [Home Page](../main-screens/home-page.md) and [Alerts Page](../main-screens/alerts-page.md)

**After clearing the alarm:**
1. Level goes to Manual mode (Yellow)
2. Operator can verify conditions are correct
3. Level can be put back into Automatic mode (Green)

## Six General Guidelines for Operating InnoPick Successfully

Following these guidelines will prevent most cascading faults and reduce troubleshooting time.

### Guideline 1: Always Compare Physical Reality to the Inventory Graph

**When responding to an Alert, always verify physical cases match their position on the Inventory Graph.**

The [Inventory Graph](../main-screens/home-page.md#inventory-graph) is the gold standard for what should be where. Physical cases should ALWAYS match the graph.

#### Why This Matters

- A good operator always double-checks visuals after clearing faults
- This is the absolute best way to avoid knock-on faults from incorrect recoveries
- Most cascading faults occur because this step was skipped

---

### Guideline 2: After Store/Dispense Alerts, Check Physical Case Position

**Always verify where the case actually ended up.**

#### After a Store Fault:
- Case should be in the storage lane
- Verify it's not blocking the photocell
- Confirm it's properly positioned

#### After a Dispense Fault:
- Case should be on the sequence conveyor
- Verify it cleared the photocell
- Confirm proper spacing to adjacent cases

#### If in doubt, check the lane case count (inventory).

This is a general guideline, but remember Guideline #1 - the Inventory Graph is your ultimate reference.

### Guideline 3: Check Replenishment Status After Any Infeed Alarm

**Infeed alarms require extra vigilance about several details.**

Infeed alarms are confusing because they occur where two different systems connect. Problems can originate on either side, and if not properly identified and corrected, more issues will follow.

#### After Every Infeed Alarm, Check:

1. **Product (SKU) is correct**
   - Case matches what was expected
   - Replenishment is for the right product

2. **Number of cases inducted (or yet-to-be inducted) is correct**
   - Go to [Replenishments Page](../main-screens/inventory-section.md#replenishments-page)
   - Verify inducted quantity
   - Check that 'quantity to induct' is accurate

3. **Upstream conveyor system has correct tracking data**
   - Cases are properly tracked upstream
   - No missing or extra cases in upstream system

4. **If cases had to be moved, follow Guideline 1**
   - Resume in Automatic mode for a few moves
   - Verify case placement on sequence conveyor
   - Ensure inventory graph matches physical reality

---

### Guideline 4: Determine if Alert is Stand-Alone or a Symptom

**Consider whether the alert is an isolated incident or indicates a bigger issue.**

#### Symptom Alerts

Certain alerts are **rarely stand-alone problems** and usually indicate previously mishandled faults or bigger issues. Correctly identifying this makes **the difference between:**
- One 4-minute stoppage (properly handled)
- Five stoppages costing 25 minutes (symptom not recognized)

#### Common Symptom Alerts:

These typically indicate inventory graph doesn't match physical reality:

- **[Fault Code 121](alert-reference.md#121---photocell-above-lane-never-detected-the-case-during-a-storing-move)**: *Photocell above lane never detected case during storing move*
- **[Fault Code 123](alert-reference.md#123---photocell-above-lane-never-detected-the-case-during-a-dispense-move)**: *Photocell never detected case during dispense move*
- ***[Expecting a case but there is no case present at the outfeed](alert-reference.md#expecting-a-case-but-there-is-no-case-present-at-the-outfeed)***
- ***[Not expecting a case but there is a case at the outfeed](alert-reference.md#not-expecting-a-case-but-there-is-a-case-at-the-outfeed)***

These faults typically show up when someone has not followed Guideline #1.

#### When You See Symptom Alerts:

1. Stop and assess the situation
2. Review recent alert history
3. Check if earlier fault was improperly resolved
4. Verify that the inventory graph matches physical reality
5. Correct any discrepancies before clearing alert and resuming production

### Guideline 5: Be Aware of InnoPick Settings

**Always understand current system settings and their implications.**

A good operator is aware of settings that affect InnoPick's behavior. Failing to understand current settings leads to serious operator mistakes.

#### Key Settings to Monitor:

##### Pause Infeed / Pause Outfeed
- Controls whether cases enter or exit InnoPick
- Check: [Home Page](../main-screens/home-page.md)

##### Build Inventory Mode
- When ON: Prioritizes storing replenishments over outputting cases
- When OFF: Balances input and output for maximum throughput
- Check: [Build Inventory](../main-screens/administration.md#build-inventory)

##### Destination (Merge) A or B Enabled / Disabled
- Controls which downstream destinations are active
- If a Merge is disabled, all cases route to other destination(s)
- Check: [Administration > Setup InnoPick > Merges](../main-screens/administration.md#merges-state)

---

### Guideline 6: Be Aware of Other System Settings

**InnoPick is connected to other systems that directly affect its behavior.**

#### Systems That Affect InnoPick:

##### MixMaster (or equivalent WMS/WCS)
**Impact Examples:**
- **HOLD on a pallet**: InnoPick won't schedule output cases for it or subsequent pallets
- **Order changes**: May affect case sequence and replenishment needs

##### Inbound Conveyor System (Pre-InnoPick)
**Impact Examples:**
- **HOLD enabled**: Cases won't be released to InnoPick
- **Tracking errors**: Wrong cases or quantities arrive
- **Photocell issues**: Cases arrive unexpectedly

##### Outbound Conveyor System (Post-InnoPick)
**Impact Examples:**
- **HOLD or fault active**: InnoPick cannot release cases at outfeed
- **Accumulation full**: Output stops even if InnoPick is ready
- **Downstream equipment down**: Cases back up into InnoPick

#### When Troubleshooting:

1. **Check downstream first** if output issues occur
2. **Check upstream first** if infeed issues occur
3. **Coordinate with other system operators** to understand full picture
4. **Verify communication** between systems is working

## Clearing Alerts

### When to Clear Alerts

Clear alerts only when:
- ✓ Underlying physical issue is resolved
- ✓ Cases are in correct positions
- ✓ Inventory graph matches reality
- ✓ Sensors are unblocked
- ✓ Mechanical issues are fixed
- ✓ Safety devices are reset

### When Alerts Won't Clear

If alerts cannot be cleared, it usually means the underlying issue has not been resolved. 

**Common reasons alerts won't clear:**

- Photocell sensor still blocked
- E-Stop button still pressed
- Door still open
- Case still in wrong position
- Mechanical issue not resolved
- The Alert in question is being filtered (not visible).
  - [See how to View All Alerts](/main-screens/alerts-page.md#viewing-all-alerts)

**What to do:**
1. Read the alert message carefully
2. Inspect physical conditions
3. Resolve the actual problem
4. Try clearing again
     - Use the [Recovery Action: Send Clear Alarm on Level](/main-screens/administration.md#most-commonly-used-recovery-actions)
5. See [Alert Reference](alert-reference.md) for specific alert resolution steps

## Recognizing Symptoms of Bigger Issues

### Single Occurrence vs. Pattern

**If an alert occurs once:**
- Likely an isolated incident
- Resolve and monitor
- Document but may not indicate systemic issue

**If same alert repeats:**
- Indicates underlying problem not fully resolved
- Stop and reassess
- Don't just keep clearing and restarting
- Look for root cause

### Multiple Related Alerts

**If different but related alerts occur in sequence:**
- May be cascading effects from one root cause
- Example: Infeed issue → Storage fault → Dispense fault
- Address the earliest/root issue first
- Verify inventory graph accuracy
- May need to stop and reset entire level

---

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Inventory Graph is Truth** - Always verify physical matches visual
2. **Verify Case Position** - After store/dispense, check where case ended up
3. **Check Replenishments** - After any infeed alarm, verify quantities and tracking
4. **Look for Root Causes** - Some alerts are symptoms, not standalone issues
5. **Know Your Settings** - Understand how system is configured
6. **Check Connected Systems** - Upstream and downstream affect InnoPick
7. **When in Doubt, Ask** - Better to escalate than cause more problems
