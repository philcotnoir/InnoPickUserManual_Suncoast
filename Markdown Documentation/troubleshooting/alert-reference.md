## Outfeed Alerts

### Expecting a case but there is no case present at the outfeed

**Explanation:**
InnoPick expects a case on the last sequence conveyor position, but no case is detected there.

**Common Causes:**
- Case never dispensed from lane
- Case fell off somewhere
- Case caught on something earlier in sequence
- Motion controller thread crashed (see alert 791)
- Sequence conveyor offset by one position
- Inventory tracking error

**Solution:**
1. Review Inventory Graph - what case is supposed to be there?
2. Inspect the outfeed area and upstream positions
3. Determine why the case is not present:
    - **Case is one spot back:** May need to jog conveyor forward
    - **Case never dispensed:** Check source lane, may need to manually dispense
    - **Case caught upstream:** Clear obstruction and position case correctly
    - **Case missing entirely:** Find replacement case

4. **Place needed case on last position:**
    - Must be the correct product
    - Must match what Inventory Graph expects
    - Must block the last sensor on InnoPick

5. Verify Inventory Graph matches physical reality
6. Clear alert
7. Resume operation
8. Monitor closely to ensure tracking is correct

**Important:** See [Alert Guidelines](alert-guidelines.md#guideline-4-determine-if-alert-is-stand-alone-or-a-symptom) - this usually indicates a tracking issue.
