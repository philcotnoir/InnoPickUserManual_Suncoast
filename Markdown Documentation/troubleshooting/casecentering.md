## Overview
InnoPick requires precise parameterization in order for cases to be accurately centered all the way from the infeed to the last buffer lane.

This page walks through the proper process for ensuring good case centering.

## Step-by-Step Sequence for Proper Case Centering

### 1. Validate Sequence Conveyor Chain Tension

- It's not uncommon to have to adjust the case centering parameters after tensionning sequence conveyor chains.
- Therefore, if it is needed, it's best to do that first.

### 2. Adjust the "Center Placement in Millimeters" Parameter

On the **Administration > Setup InnoPick > [Site Levels](../main-screens/administration/setup-innopick.md#site-levels)** page, adjust the **"Center placement in millimeters"** parameter so that cases are properly centered in front of the first buffer lane (the one closest to the infeed).

**Procedure:**

1. Stop InnoPick when a case is positioned in front of the first lane (closest to the infeed).
2. Calculate the adjustment required to be centered
    - **Example**: The case is too far in the downstream direction, by 10mm
3. Modify the **"Center placement in millimeters"** by **-10**, and let a new case enter to re-validate
    - ⚠️ **Note**: The change will only be applied to the next case that is inducted on the infeed section of the upstream conveyor
4. Continue until cases are properly centered in front of the first lane

### 3. Test Alignment Along the Entire Length of InnoPick

Next, place a perfectly centered case in front of the first lane, and manually jog the sequence conveyor until the case is in front of the last lane (nearest the outfeed).

**Important**: When you jog, make sure that the value used for the jogging (on the Manual Motion Controls page) is the same as the **"Lane Pitch in Millimeters"** parameter on the Site Levels page.
- It is usually necessary to input the correct distance from the Lane Pitch paramater for this exercise, in order to recreate the actual movement distances seen in production.

### 4. Measure the Necessary Adjustment

- Go to the case stopped in front of the last buffer lane.
- Measure the adjustment necessary for it be properly centered, and divide the adjustment by the number of positions on the sequence conveyor (visible on the inventory graph).

- In the example above, there are 71 positions.

### 5. Calculate the Lane Pitch Correction

**Example:**

- Need to adjust the position by **12mm toward upstream** (case is too far toward downstream)
- The InnoPick has **71 positions**
- Calculation: **12mm ÷ 71 positions = 0.17mm**

---

### 6. Apply the Correction

Adjust the **"Lane Pitch in Millimeters"** parameter by the result of your calculation in Step 5.
**Important Note:** 
    - If the adjustment is towards the upstream, subtract the value from the current Lane Pitch distance. This will reduce the size of the standard move and result in the case moving a smaller distance, ending up more upstream.
    - If the adjustment is towards the downstream, add the value to the current Lane Pitch distance. This will increase the size of the standard move and result in the case moving a greater distance, ending up further downstream.

**Example (continued):**
- If our calculation resulted in a value of 0.17mm
- And the Lane Pitch parameter is currently at **558.80mm**
- We will subtract the calculated value from the parameter value:
- **558.80 - 0.17 = 558.63mm**

---

### 7. Final Validation

Validate the new value by repeating the test and ensuring that the case ends up properly centered in front of the last lane (near the outfeed).

## Parameter Summary

| Parameter | Location | Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Center Placement in Millimeters** | Administration > Setup InnoPick > Site Levels | Used to set initial center position, which is validated in front of the **first** lane |
| **Lane Pitch in Millimeters** | Administration > Setup InnoPick > Site Settings | Defines the standard sequence conveyor move distance, used for maintaining centering along the **entire length** of InnoPick, and validated in front of the **last** lane |

---

## Calculation Formula
```
Lane Pitch Adjustment = Total Error (mm) ÷ Number of Positions
```

**Direction of adjustments:**
- Case too far **downstream** → **Negative** (-) adjustment
- Case too far **upstream** → **Positive** (+) adjustment
