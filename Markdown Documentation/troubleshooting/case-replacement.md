## Overview

This page provides procedures for replacing broken, missing, or incorrect cases during InnoPick operation. Proper case replacement is critical to maintaining accurate inventory tracking and preventing cascading faults.

<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background-color: #747474; margin: 2em 0;">

## When Case Replacement is Needed

Common scenarios requiring case replacement:

- **Broken case**: Case damaged, collapsed, or torn
- **Missing case**: Case fell off, removed, or never present
- **Wrong product**: Incorrect SKU inducted
- **Quality issue**: Case rejected for damage or defects
- **Operator error**: Case removed during troubleshooting

## General Principles

### Before Replacing Any Case

1. **Understand why the case needs replacement**
    - What happened to the original case?
    - Is this an isolated incident or pattern?
    - Will the same issue affect the replacement?

2. **Determine the correct product**
    - Check what product is expected
    - Verify SKU from alert message or Inventory Graph
    - Confirm with [Replenishments Page](../main-screens/inventory-section.md#replenishments-page) or [Case Sequence Page](../main-screens/case-sequence.md)

3. **Know where to place the replacement**
    - Sequence conveyor vs. storage lane
    - Specific position on conveyor

## Scenario 1: Replace Case Currently Being Inducted

**Situation:**
- Case is currently part of an active replenishment
- Case is already in InnoPick
- Case is broken, too damaged, or wrong product

### Procedure

1. **Obtain replacement case:**
    - Take one from upstream conveyor system
    - Ensure it's the correct product

2. **Update upstream system:**
    - Delete 1 Case Data on upstream conveyor HMI
    - This prevents tracking mismatch

3. **Short the replenishment in InnoPick Manager:**
    - Go to [Replenishments Page](../main-screens/inventory-section.md#replenishments-page)
    - Find the active replenishment
    - Use **Alter Quantity** action (three dots menu)
    - Reduce quantity by 1

4. **Place replacement case:**
    - Position on the case exactly where the broken was (or was supposed to be)
    - Ensure proper orientation
   
5. **Resume operation:**
    - Clear any alerts if present
    - Verify the case stores correctly
    - Monitor the transition to the next replenishment

## Scenario 2: Damaged Inbound Case on Sequence Conveyor is Not Needed for Client Pallet

**Situation:**
- Case is on the sequence conveyor and is going to be stored
- No replacement cases are readily available
- Case will NOT be needed for upcoming orders
  - This can be determined if: There are no additional replenishment scheduled for this product (filter for this product & level in the Replenishments page to determine this).

**If no other replenishment scheduled:**
- InnoPick can function without this case
- Case can be shorted rather than replaced
- **Replacement is optional**

### Procedure

#### Short the Case

1. **Allow the storage move to fault:**
    - **[Alert 121 (photocell never detected case)](../troubleshooting/alert-reference.md#121---photocell-above-lane-never-detected-the-case-during-a-storing-move)** will occur
    - System expects to store a case but finds none

2. **Jog lane so it is ready to dispense**
    - Use [Manual motion control > Lane Operations](../main-screens/administration/manual-motion-control.md#lane-operations)
    - Jog lane forward so existing cases move up
    - Front case can now be dispensed

3. **Short the lane inventory:**
    - Go to [Lane Inventory Page](../main-screens/inventory-section.md#lane-inventory-page)
    - Find the affected lane
    - Reduce quantity by 1

4. **Clear alerts and resume**

## Scenario 3: Replace Missing Outfeed Case

**Situation:**
- Alert: "Expecting a case but there is no case present at the outfeed"
- Case should be at last InnoPick position but is missing
- See [Alert Reference](alert-reference.md#expecting-a-case-but-there-is-no-case-present-at-the-outfeed) for detailed alert resolution

### Procedure

1. **Identify the expected case:**
    - Check [Inventory Graph](../main-screens/home-page.md#inventory-graph)
    - Note product SKU and pallet ID
    - Determine from which lane it should have come

2. **Determine why case is missing:**
    - Was it never dispensed from lane?
    - Did it fall off somewhere?
    - Was it incorrectly removed?
    - Is sequence conveyor offset by one position?

3. **Obtain replacement case:**
    - Must be exact product that was expected
    - Check case label/markings

4. **Place case at outfeed position:**
    - Must block the last sensor on InnoPick
    - Position correctly for downstream equipment
    - Verify orientation

5. **Verify Inventory Graph:**
    - Should now show filled square at last position
    - Matches physical case

6. **Clear alert and resume**

7. **Monitor closely:**
    - Verify subsequent cases are tracking correctly
    - Watch for signs of offset sequence conveyor

## Special Considerations

### Quality Control

If replacing due to quality issue:
- Note the specific problem
- Report pattern of defects to supervision
- May indicate supplier issue

### Inventory Accuracy

After any replacement:
- Verify all counts are correct
- Check [Lane Inventory](../main-screens/inventory-section.md#lane-inventory-page)
- Confirm [Replenishments Page](../main-screens/inventory-section.md#replenishments-page) quantities
- Ensure [Inventory Graph](../main-screens/home-page.md#inventory-graph) matches reality

## Preventing Case Replacement Needs

### Best Practices

**Visual Inspections:**
- Check case quality of the cases in InnoPick
- Monitor cases as they induct

**Proper Handling:**
- Ensure upstream handling doesn't damage cases
- Ensure upstream handling properly identifies and rejects damaged or turned cases

**Maintain Tracking Accuracy:**
- Always follow [Alert Guidelines](alert-guidelines.md)
- Verify Inventory Graph after every alert
