### Level status

- This page provides an overview of each level's various statuses as well as:
  - Last case data sent (CaseRef #)
  - Last pending completion (CaseRef #)

### Merges state

Configuration for downstream merge points (where the different levels combine to a single conveyor that feeds one of the palletizers).

#### Merge A / B Enabled

Enable or disable individual downstream destinations.

**Purpose:**
- Route all cases to operational Merge if one fails
- Handle downstream equipment failures
- Temporary operational adjustments

**Usage:**
- Last resort when downstream fault cannot be resolved
- Will not affect cases already on sequence conveyors -- those cases that are already scheduled for a certain destination will retain their destination.
- High likelihood that remote support interventions will be required if this is changed during production.

**Caution**: *Only use when absolutely necessary and coordinate with support. Can have unintended effects and complications.*

#### Destination assignment mode

There are two possible settings for the destination assignment mode:
1. None
2. Just-in-time

**None:** This is the regular destination mode:
- InnoPick will initially load balance pallet assignment when receiving a new case sequence
- Will never change a destination unless a destination is disabled

**Just in time:** 
- InnoPick will initially load balance pallet assignment when receiving a new case sequence (like normal)
- InnoPick may change the destination when the first case of a pallet gets scheduled, based on the remaining accumulation available to load balance assignments "Just-in-Time"
- In this mode, InnoPick responds dynamically to current accumulation levels and assigns pallets to the destination with the most capacity.
