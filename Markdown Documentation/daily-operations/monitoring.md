## Overview

During production, operators should actively monitor InnoPick Manager to ensure smooth operation, catch problems early, and maintain production efficiency.

## Primary Monitoring Dashboard

The [Home Page](../main-screens/home-page.md) provides all essential information for monitoring production at a glance.

### Key Elements to Monitor

1. **[Level Status Indicators](../main-screens/home-page.md#level-statuses--auto--manual-controls)**
    - **Green**: Level is in Automatic mode and operating normally
    - **Yellow**: Level is in Manual mode (paused)
    - **Red**: Level has an active fault
    - **Dark Red**: E-Stop condition is active
    - **Blue**: Communication Loss

2. **[Inventory Graph](../main-screens/home-page.md#inventory-graph)**
    - Visual representation of all cases on sequence conveyors
    - Squares = Outbound cases (for customer pallets)
    - Triangles = Inbound cases (replenishments being stored)
    - Filled shapes = Physical cases present
    - Hollow shapes = Scheduled case positions

3. **[Alerts List](../main-screens/home-page.md#alerts-list)**
    - Shows current system alerts
    - Alerts appear when issues require attention
    - Go to the Alerts page for more details. 

4. **[Production Graph](../main-screens/home-page.md#production-graph)**
    - Shows progress of current production run
    - Green bar = In Progress cases
    - Orange bar = Completed cases
    - Red line = Total cases in current orders

5. **[Lane Inventory](../main-screens/home-page.md#lane-inventory)**
    - Select a level to view storage lane status
    - Hover over lanes for detailed inventory info
    - Monitor for abnormal low inventory levels

## What to Watch During Production

### Continuous Monitoring Tasks

**Every 15-30 Minutes:**

- Glance at level status indicators (all should be green)
- Check for new alerts
- Verify production progress is advancing

**Every 1-2 Hours:**

- Check replenishment status
- Monitor case sequence progress

**Throughout the Shift:**

- Listen for unusual mechanical sounds
- Watch for stopped or hesitating conveyors
- Be aware of downstream system status

<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background-color: #747474; margin: 2em 0;">

## Recognizing Normal Operation

When InnoPick is operating correctly:

- All levels show **green** status
- Cases move smoothly through the system
- **Inventory Graph** shows cases advancing position by position
- **Production Graph** shows steady progress
- **Alerts List** is empty or shows only minor warnings
- Replenishments are being inducted as needed
- Output cases are feeding downstream without backing up

<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background-color: #747474; margin: 2em 0;">

## Recognizing Problems Early

### Warning Signs to Watch For

**Immediate Attention Required:**

- Any level turns **Red** (fault condition)
- E-Stop condition (all levels **Dark Red**)
- Critical alerts appear
- Cases stopped on conveyors
- Unusual sounds or movements

**Monitor Closely:**

- Repeated alerts of the same type
- Accumulation building up at outfeed
- Replenishments not arriving as scheduled


<hr style="border: none; height: 3px; background-color: #747474; margin: 2em 0;">

## Responding to Alerts

When an alert occurs:

1. **Note the alert details**
    - Which level is affected
    - What type of alert (code and message)
    - Time of occurrence

2. **Assess the situation**
    - Is it a single occurrence or repeating?
    - Is production stopped or continuing?

3. **Take appropriate action**
    - For common alerts: Follow [Alert Reference](../troubleshooting/alert-reference.md)
    - For safety issues: Use E-Stop if necessary.
    - For unknown issues: Contact supervisor, maintenance, or remote support.


See [Alert Guidelines](../troubleshooting/alert-guidelines.md) for detailed alert resolution procedures.

## Monitoring Replenishments

Replenishments ensure InnoPick has adequate inventory to fulfill orders.

### What to Monitor

Access the [Replenishments Page](../main-screens/inventory-section.md#replenishments-page) to check:

- **Pending**: Replenishments requested but not yet started
- **In Progress**: Replenishments being prepared for induction
- **Inducting**: Replenishments currently entering InnoPick
- **Completed**: Replenishments fully inducted

### When to Take Action

**Normal**: Replenishments progress from Pending → In Progress → Inducting → Completed

**Problem Indicators:**

- Inducted Quantity doesn't match expected quantity
- Replenishments backing up at infeed

**Action**: Coordinate with upstream depalletizing operations or see [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/index.md)

## Understanding System Settings That Affect Operations

Be aware of these settings and their effects:

**[Build Inventory Mode](../main-screens/administration/setup-innopick.md#build-inventory)**

- When ON: Prioritizes storing replenishment cases over outputting cases
- When OFF: Balances input and output for maximum throughput

**[Pause Infeed / Pause Outfeed](../main-screens/home-page.md#pause--resume-infeed)**

- Controls whether cases enter or exit InnoPick
- Check: [Home Page](../main-screens/home-page.md)

## Shift Handoff Checklist

When ending your shift, review with the next operator:

- Current system status and any active alerts
- Any recurring issues or unusual behavior observed
- Replenishments in progress or pending
- Any lanes disabled or products having problems
- Upcoming scheduled maintenance or system changes
- Any instructions from supervision
