Identify some lanes on that level with low inventory (1-10 cases)   2. Makes sure those cases are not immediately going to be needed (using the Case Sequence Page)   3. Empty those lanes, making them available.</p> <p>Alternatively, another option is to: 1. Identify which product InnoPick needs in order to resume outputting cases (this is listed in the Alert message). 2. Filter the Case Sequence Page to see how many cases of this product are needed.  3. Manually load this number of cases of the required product in an empty lane on that level of InnoPick.  4. Edit the inventory for that lane and save the changes, using the Inventory Page.  5. Upon saving the changes to the inventory change, the system should recalculate the case sequence for that level and production should resume. 6.
